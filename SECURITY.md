## AlterWare Security
We take security very seriously at AlterWare. We welcome any peer review of our 100% free software source code to ensure no user is ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately.
Please e-mail alterware@proton.me directly to provide details and repro steps.

We will try respond as soon as possible, but please note:

### This is an entirely free software project. It is maintained in our spare time.
### We cannot guarantee quick responses but we very much appreciate your discretion when reporting security vulnerabilities.
